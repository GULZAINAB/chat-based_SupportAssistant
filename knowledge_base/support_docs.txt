Wi-Fi Troubleshooting
Common Issues: Slow internet, unable to connect, frequent disconnections, "no internet access" error
Step-by-Step Solution:

Check Wi-Fi Status: Ensure Wi-Fi is turned on in your device settings. Look for the Wi-Fi icon in your system tray (Windows) or menu bar (macOS).
Power Cycle Network Equipment: Restart your router and modem by unplugging them for 30 seconds, then plugging back in. Wait 2-3 minutes for full startup.
Reconnect to Network: Go to Wi-Fi settings, forget your current network, then reconnect by selecting the correct SSID and entering the password again. Make sure you're connecting to your network, not a neighbor's.
Run Network Diagnostics:

Windows: Settings > Network & Internet > Status > Network troubleshooter
macOS: Hold Option key + click Wi-Fi icon > Open Wireless Diagnostics


Check Multiple Devices: Test if other devices (phones, tablets, laptops) can connect. If none can connect, the issue is with your internet service provider (ISP) - contact them for support.
Advanced Troubleshooting:

Check if you're close enough to the router (try moving closer)
Restart your network adapter: Device Manager > Network adapters > Right-click your Wi-Fi adapter > Disable, then Enable
Reset network settings if other steps fail



When to Contact Support: If none of these steps work, or if the problem persists after trying all solutions.

System Restart Procedures
When to Restart: System running slowly, programs freezing, after software installations, or when experiencing general performance issues
Normal Restart Process:

Save Your Work: Close all applications and save any open documents to prevent data loss.
Initiate Restart:

Windows: Click Start button > Power icon > Restart
macOS: Apple menu (🍎) > Restart
Linux: System menu > Power Off/Log Out > Restart


Wait for Complete Restart: Allow the system to fully shut down and boot up again (usually 2-5 minutes).

Force Restart (When System is Frozen):

Last Resort Only: Use this method only when the system is completely unresponsive.
Force Shutdown: Press and hold the physical power button for 10-15 seconds until the system completely shuts down.
Wait and Restart: Wait 10-20 seconds, then press the power button once to turn the system back on.
Check for Errors: After restart, the system may run a disk check or show recovery options - follow the prompts.

Post-Restart Tips: If you had to force restart, run a disk check and consider updating your system to prevent future freezes.

Change Date and Time Settings
Windows 10/11:

Access Settings: Right-click on the date/time in the taskbar and select "Adjust date/time", or go to Settings > Time & Language > Date & time.
Disable Automatic Time: Turn off "Set time automatically" toggle switch.
Manual Time Setting: Click "Change" button under "Set the date and time manually".
Adjust Settings: Set the correct date and time, then click "Change" to save.
Time Zone: If needed, also adjust your time zone in the same settings page.
Sync Time: You can re-enable "Set time automatically" to sync with internet time servers.

macOS:

System Preferences: Apple menu > System Preferences > Date & Time
Unlock Settings: Click the lock icon and enter your administrator password
Manual Setting: Uncheck "Set date and time automatically"
Adjust: Click on the date and time fields to modify them directly
Time Zone: Use the "Time Zone" tab to adjust your location if needed

Why This Matters: Incorrect date/time can cause issues with file synchronization, email, security certificates, and software licensing.

Clear Browser Cache
Google Chrome:

Open Clear Data Menu: Click the three dots (⋮) in the top-right corner > More tools > Clear browsing data, or press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+Delete (macOS).
Select Time Range: Choose how far back to clear data (Last hour, 24 hours, 7 days, 4 weeks, or All time).
Choose Data Types: Check "Cached images and files" at minimum. You may also want to clear "Cookies and other site data" if experiencing login issues.
Clear Data: Click "Clear data" button and wait for the process to complete.
Restart Browser: Close and reopen Chrome for best results.

Other Browsers:

Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete > Check "Cache" > Clear Now
Safari: Safari menu > Clear History > Select time range
Edge: Three dots > Settings > Privacy, search, and services > Clear browsing data

When to Clear Cache: If websites aren't loading properly, you see old/outdated content, or experiencing slow browsing performance.
What This Does: Removes temporary files that websites store on your computer, which can become corrupted or outdated.

Update Device Drivers
Windows Device Manager Method:

Open Device Manager: Right-click Start button > Device Manager, or press Windows key + X and select Device Manager.
Identify Problem Devices: Look for devices with yellow warning triangles or red X marks indicating driver issues.
Select Device Category: Expand the relevant category (e.g., Display adapters, Network adapters, Audio inputs and outputs).
Update Driver: Right-click on the specific device > "Update driver" > "Search automatically for drivers".
Follow Prompts: Windows will search online for the best driver and install it automatically.
Restart if Needed: Some driver updates require a system restart to take effect.

Alternative Update Methods:

Windows Update: Settings > Windows Update > Check for updates (often includes driver updates)
Manufacturer Website: Visit the device manufacturer's website to download specific drivers
Device Manager Rollback: If a new driver causes issues, right-click device > Properties > Driver tab > "Roll Back Driver"

Common Driver Types to Update:

Graphics/Display: For better performance and compatibility with games/software
Network: To fix connectivity issues
Audio: To resolve sound problems
USB/Bluetooth: For peripheral device connectivity

Signs You Need Driver Updates: Device not working properly, poor performance, error messages mentioning drivers, or after major Windows updates.
